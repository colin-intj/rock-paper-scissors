This repository contains a web-based version of the classic game Rock Paper
Scissors, which is also one of my projects for The Odin Project's Foundations
course. As of right now, the game has barely any CSS, but I plan on adding more
in the future. I also plan on creating SVG images representing each move the
player can make, and I'll create custom popups that I'll style with CSS.
